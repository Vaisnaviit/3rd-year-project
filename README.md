The primary objective of this project was to develop an efficient and user-friendly food ordering system that works based on table numbers in a restaurant. The system ensures that orders are accurately taken from each table and sent directly to the kitchen, reducing human error and enhancing customer experience.

Traditional food ordering systems in restaurants often involve waiters manually taking orders, which can lead to miscommunication, delays, and inefficiencies. The problem this project aims to solve is the time-consuming and error-prone nature of manual order-taking by implementing a digital, table-specific ordering system that streamlines restaurant operations.

With this system, customers sitting at a table can place orders directly from the website, and the kitchen receives the corresponding table number along with the order details, eliminating order mix-ups and improving overall service speed.
